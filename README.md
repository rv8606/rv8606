- 👋 Hi, I’m @rv8606
- 👀 I’m interested in website design, drone flying, flying elephants and a lot of things I will never be able to understand...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Sass, Cloud computing but on my own.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything, because I don't feel I'm good enough, but I have my own projects on course and I think they could have their place on Github...
- 📫 You can contact me per mail at contact[at]unemployaid[dot]com ...
